This premium service is rapidly becoming one of the most sought after fee based services for professional traders and serious investors interested in knowing what these markets are on the verge of doing each and every day. Knowing when these markets are topping or bottoming out is one of the most critical components to savvy trading and investing. Knowing which sectors are hot and which ones are not can make the difference between stellar and modest returns.</p>
<p>The <strong>SCN EO</strong> service is published in the middle of every trading day and provides daily market commentary, technical analysis, select ETF trades for a long or short market and more importantly, individual company ideas the <strong>SCN EO Analytical Team</strong> has identified as early opportunities for <strong>potentially blockbuster returns</strong>. In addition, when to buy, when to sell and how to manage one's dynamic portfolio are all just a few components to this all-encompassing valuable service.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="<?= $SCNEO_LINK ?>"><img src="<?= $this->internal->vars->static_host ?>/css/community/smallcapnetwork/assets/scneo/logo.png" alt="SmallCap Network Elite Opportunity" width="294" height="77" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The markets dictate our selections based on momentum, sector, technical and fundamental performance. Our picks are predicated on what we believe to be the most important aspect of trading or investing in anything, <strong>risk vs. reward</strong>. It's important to understand there is no reward without risk, so make sure you always assess your own individual financial situation and risk tolerance before acting on anything. <strong>Everyone's timelines, goals and strategies are different.</strong></p>
<p>To immediately activate your subscription to <strong>SCN EO</strong>, go here: <a href="<?= $SCNEO_LINK ?>"><?= $SCNEO_LINK ?></a>. You can unsubscribe at any time, <strong>no strings attached</strong>. However, we believe if you are willing to give this unique and valuable service a real opportunity to help your trading or investment returns, we're convinced <strong>you won't be disappointed</strong>. Although we have continued to receive so many positive testimonials since launching this premium service, <strong>our returns with respect to individual company ideas speaks for itself</strong>.</p>

<p>If you're still not convinced that you should subscribe to our <strong>Elite Opportunity</strong> premium service, that's Ok. In the FREE SmallCap Network Community Newsletter you will begin receiving, we will be including some premium picks and other timely information from the <strong>Elite Opportunity</strong> team.  While so many other financial sites can be misleading and often tricky in terms of trying to get your business, <strong>we are willing to earn it</strong>. Meaning, we want to help you make money and if we do, we'd like nothing more than for you to become a <strong>premium paid member</strong> here: <a href="<?= $SCNEO_LINK ?>"><strong><?= $SCNEO_LINK ?></strong></a>. Simply put, it's how we make money while continuing to try and make you money.  <strong>We will work diligently to bring you both short and long-term ideas we believe will dramatically outperform the major averages in an effort to get you to convert to a premium Member.</strong> When we send out an alert, we will clearly deem the idea in question as either a short-term idea, a long-term idea or both.</p>
<p><strong>With that being said, we hope you enjoy our service and more importantly, find it profitable for you, your family and your future.</strong></p>
