<p><strong>Dear SCN Elite Opportunity Free Alerts Member,</strong></p>

<p><strong>Welcome!</strong> I'm happy to find out you've made the choice to become a <strong>SmallCap Network Elite Opportunity Free Alerts Member</strong>. We're excited to help you identify select opportunities in the equity markets to profit from and it's entirely possible we may have something for you as early as this week or next, so be on the lookout. <strong>We're not hyperactive so be patient.</strong></p>
<p>The markets dictate our selections based on momentum, sector, technical and fundamental performance. Our picks are predicated on what we believe to be the most important aspect of trading or investing in anything, <strong>risk vs. reward</strong>. It's important to understand there is no reward without risk, so make sure you always assess your own individual financial situation and risk tolerance before acting on anything. <strong>Everyone's timelines, goals and strategies are different.</strong></p>
<p>Alerts will first be sent via mobile text and then email. If for some reason you chose not to provide your mobile number to receive text alerts, no worries, you'll receive them via email.</p>
<p>While we're on the subject of <strong>mobile text alerts</strong>, there have been some members that have had some trouble adding their mobile number to our list. This is primarily due to incorrectly inputting the country code in front of your area code and phone number.</p>
<p>If you've been having trouble, <a href="https://www.smallcapnetwork.com/member/scneol/verify/vmpd_bpip/1/?id=<?= $this->id ?>&email=<?= $this->email ?>">go here</a> to <a href="https://www.smallcapnetwork.com/member/scneol/verify/vmpd_bpip/1/?id=<?= $this->id ?>&email=<?= $this->email ?>">update your mobile settings</a>. Make sure to <strong>read the instructions</strong> carefully and <strong>include your correct country code to begin with</strong>. When done, for <strong>US members</strong>, it should look something like this: 16195551212. For <strong>international members</strong>, just start with your country code and <strong>do NOT</strong> start with 011 or 00. <strong>Once you receive our verification code via text, enter it on the verification page and you're done!</strong></p>
<p>Before I let you go today, I want to be completely honest and communicate why we've decided to provide this free alerts service for you and others. While so many other financial sites can be misleading and often tricky in terms of trying to get your business, <strong>we want to earn it</strong>. Meaning, we want to help you make money and if we do, we'd like nothing more than for you to become a <strong>premium paid member</strong> here: <a href="https://www.smallcapnetwork.com/pages/SCNEO/v1/"><strong>https://www.smallcapnetwork.com/pages/SCNEO/v1/</strong></a>. Simply put, it's how we make money while continuing to try and make you money.</p>
<p>I can tell you this... <strong>We will work diligently to bring you both short and long-term ideas we believe will dramatically outperform the major averages in an effort to get you to convert to a premium Member.</strong> When we send out an alert, we will clearly deem the idea in question as either a short-term idea, a long-term idea or both.</p>
<p><strong>With that being said, we hope you enjoy our service and more importantly, find it profitable for you, your family and your future.</strong></p>

<p style="clear: both;">Warmest Regards,</p>
<p><strong>John Monroe and the SCN EO Team<br><a href="https://www.smallcapnetwork.com/pages/SCNEO/v1/">SCN Elite Opportunity</a></strong></p>
