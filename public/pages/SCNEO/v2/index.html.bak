      <h5>Dear Fellow Investor,</h5>
      <p>The stock market continues to prove stocks are the preferred investment asset class of choice. Our current economic environment is providing more of an opportunity to grow our retirement and investment portfolios than ever before. However, <em>knowing when is the right time</em> and <em>which stocks to invest</em> in will always be the most important aspect to investing for maximum returns. We here at <strong>SmallCap Network</strong> have the knowledge and experience to help you find the right opportunities at the right time. Yes, the testimonials you see here on this page have been provided by actual long-time subscribers and the charts you see here are for real. These are just a few of many ideas we suggested throughout 2012. And, let me make it very clear, <em>only a few of these were highly-speculative, high-risk type ideas, <strong>yet the returns on most of them were stellar</strong></em>.</p>
      <p>While most paid subscription newsletters these days spend more time touting their one modest success, instilling fear, doom and gloom, not to mention their sole focus of getting new subscribers to walk through their revolving door, our dedicated team of analysts here at the <strong>SmallCap Network</strong> is committed to the markets and devoted to uncovering stocks that will yield the type of returns only the savviest of investors will ever experience.</p>

      <p>We live and breathe the markets every day. We monitor the markets' every move. We're constantly scouring the various industry sectors with a fine tooth comb in an effort to identify the best and most profitable opportunities, before the rest of Wall Street has even caught on.</p>
      <p>We don't discriminate. There's money to be made in every market environment. Long, short, options, small caps, large caps, micro caps, you name itâ€¦ If you spend enough time searching out and analyzing the markets with an objective and unbiased behavior, you can solidify a financial future.  The type of financial future that has made many investors multi-millionaires over the course of time.</p>

      <p>Many investors are often left scratching their heads wondering why their value stock continues to go south. Just as important as it is to invest in good solid companies, it's equally as important to understand and know what the broader markets are doing, in addition to knowing when exactly is the right time to buy or sell a specific idea. When an investor knows and understands where the broader markets are headed and why, only then do they have a distinct advantage over the rest of the investing population.</p>
      <p>Fundamental or technical analysis, which is better? Depending on whom you talk to, veterans of each camp will tell you either technical analysis or fundamental analysis is the only way to go. This is another investing facade. The truth is charts are equally as important as fundamentals and vice versa. In order to maximize investing returns, <strong>it's equally as important to know when to invest in a particular idea, <em>as it is to know which idea to invest in</em>.</strong></p>

      <p>And, if you're wondering why we don't charge less, the answer is quite simple again. Our information is not only worth a lot more, it's also our way of keeping the masses out of our way and our discreet analysis off the radar. When too many people are hearing about an extremely hot opportunity, it can often become an overly crowded trade. That wouldn't be good for you or us.</p>
      <p>Once you become a <strong>SmallCap Network Elite Opportunity Member</strong>, you can then ignore all of the touts and false promises made by so many other newsletters that only end up failing to deliver.</p>
      <p>The bottom line is this. Regardless of what many will tell you, identifying the right ideas isn't easy, there's no easy recipe and there's definitely no obvious homeruns when it comes to investing in stocks. It's a big boy's and big girl's game that rewards the most diligent investors. Let us start working for you. We don't think you'll be disappointed, at all.</p>
