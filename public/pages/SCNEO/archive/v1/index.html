      <p><a href="javascript:gotoSection('section2');"><img src="inc/img/total_pick_inception.gif" alt="Total Pick Performance Since Inception (2013) of Over 1,982%" width="400" height="289" align="right" /></a>We here at <strong>SmallCap Elite Opportunity (SCN EO)</strong> understand your needs and desires to <em>maximize your capital and get the absolute most out of the stock market</em>, <strong>so I'm not going to beat around the bush</strong>. We've scoured the Web and have looked at countless other premium subscription based stock advisory services and <strong>we haven't found ANYBODY ANYWHERE with a better track record than us since our inception in January of 2013!</strong></p>
      <p>We've given our Members <strong>blockbuster winner after winner</strong>, month after month for a <strong>total pick performance return of over 1,982% from 2013 through 2014</strong>. Is this by chance? Absolutely not. <em>We delivered very similar results in 2012 and the overall markets didn't even perform very well that year.</em></p>
      <p>While most paid subscription newsletters spend more time touting their few modest successes, their one big win, or are too busy instilling fear, doom and gloom, our dedicated team of analysts here at <strong>SCN EO</strong> are committed to the markets and <strong>devoted to uncovering stocks</strong> that will yield the type of returns only the savviest of investors will ever experience.</p>

      <h2>Performance:<strong>Don't believe us? We can prove it.</strong></h2>
      <p>First, as you can see by our <strong>Top 10 trades for 2013 and 2014, our consistency is unparalleled</strong>. <em><strong>The returns are nothing short of stellar.</strong></em> And, all you had to do was buy each one and hold it. It wasn't even necessary for you to flip in and out of any of these stocks to amass the type of gains you see here. And, <strong>not one of these stocks were an overly speculative penny stock play</strong>. These are real companies with real business models and real fundamentals, or extremely liquid ETF's.</p>
      <p>Second, by taking advantage of our limited time offer right now, you will have immediate access to our exclusive password protected Member area. There, you will find every single archived daily newsletter edition to check our analysis at any point throughout the year. <strong>You can back test any or all of it. We've got nothing to hide, EVER.</strong></p>
      <p>Within our password protected Member section, you will also find every single individual stock we've suggested, when we suggested it, SSL's and suggested target prices, as well as all of our current open ideas with the same information. We are as transparent, or in most cases more transparent, than any other stock advisory service out there.</p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy:<strong>Experience, Dedication and Diligence</strong></h2>
      
      <p>We live and breathe the markets every day. We monitor the markets' every move. We're constantly scouring the various industry sectors with a fine tooth comb in an effort to identify the best and most profitable opportunities, before the rest of Wall Street has even caught on.</p>
      <p>We don't discriminate. There's money to be made in every market environment. Long, short, options, small caps, large caps, micro caps, you name it… If you spend enough time searching out and analyzing the markets with an objective and unbiased behavior, you can solidify a financial future.  The type of financial future that has made many investors multi-millionaires over the course of time.</p>
      <h3>However, it's no easy task.<br />
        <strong>It takes countless hours of research, experience and<br />
        an unwavering dedication to due diligence.</strong></h3>
      
      <p>Many investors are often left scratching their heads wondering why their value stock continues to go south. Just as important as it is to invest in good solid companies, it's equally as important to understand and know what the broader markets are doing, in addition to knowing when exactly is the right time to buy or sell a specific idea. When an investor knows and understands where the broader markets are headed and why, only then do they have a distinct advantage over the rest of the investing population.</p>
      <p>Fundamental or technical analysis, which is better? Depending on whom you talk to, veterans of each camp will tell you either technical analysis or fundamental analysis is the only way to go. This is another investing facade. The truth is charts are equally as important as fundamentals and vice versa. In order to maximize investing returns, <strong>it's equally as important to know when to invest in a particular idea, <em style="font-weight: bold;">as it is to know which idea to invest in</em>.</strong></p>

      <h2>Your Opportunity:<br />
        <strong>An Integral Part of Your Investing Arsenal</strong></h2>

      <p><strong>As you can see, we're serious about delivering you an opportunity to improve your financial future.</strong> You only have so much time in the day. We're making ourselves available to you in a dedicated fashion that makes us an integral part of your investing arsenal.</p>
      <p>We're here to help you create a better financial future for yourself and your family. We're not going to let anyone decide for us or pay us to suggest an opportunity. By becoming a SmallCap Network Elite Opportunity Member, you will have a dedicated and highly experienced team of individuals working on your behalf every day to keep you up-to-date and well informed on the stock market and its winning ways.</p>
      <p>Is there really much to think about? For just $99 per month or less, depending on which subscription package you choose, you will now have the necessary arsenal at your fingertips to exploit the markets for maximum returns.  You can't even play a single round of golf in many cities anymore for less than $99. However, by getting our daily market analysis, select stock recommendations and invaluable continuing education on the subject of investing in stocks, you'll be putting yourself and your family in a much better position to dramatically improve your long-term financial future.</p>
      <h3>Ask yourself this question, "Would I pay a dedicated team of experienced professionals a total of $99 per month who will work diligently five days a week to help me become more profitable?"<br />
        <strong>The answer should be pretty simple.</strong></h3>
      
      <p>And, if you're wondering why we don't charge less, the answer is quite simple again. Our information is not only worth a lot more, it's also our way of keeping the masses out of our way and our discreet analysis off the radar. When too many people are hearing about an extremely hot opportunity, it can often become an overly crowded trade. That wouldn't be good for you or us.</p>
      <p>Once you become a <strong>SmallCap Network Elite Opportunity Member</strong>, you can then ignore all of the touts and false promises made by so many other newsletters that only end up failing to deliver.</p>
      <p>The bottom line is this. Regardless of what many will tell you, identifying the right ideas isn't easy, there's no easy recipe and there's definitely no obvious homeruns when it comes to investing in stocks. It's a big boy's and big girl's game that rewards the most diligent investors. Let us start working for you. We don't think you'll be disappointed, at all.</p>
      <h3><em>Becoming a SCN Elite Opportunity Member only takes a couple of minutes <strong>and you will have immediate access to everything mentioned above.</strong></em></h3>

                            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dear SCN Elite Opportunity Members,</strong></font></p>
                            <!-- BEGIN ARCHIVE CUT -->

                            <p>Although all of the major indices are off on the morning, they've yet to crack yesterday's lows. If that happens, it's likely another sharp move lower heading into tomorrow's options expiration. However, should they hold and find a bid at some point today, without taking out yesterday's low, it may suggest yesterday's sharp capitulation was enough to rally these markets for at least a few days.</p>
                            <p><strong><img src="https://static.viame.com/public_files/2014-10-16-Newsletter/2014/10/16/504a9785263f05f3009f33d7c8d7edfd/ndx.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #000;" /></strong>I want to quickly point out there is one particular reversal signal I'd really like to see on the <strong>NASDAQ 100 (NDX)</strong> today to provide further context these markets are done moving lower for a while. I've included an hourly bar chart of the <strong>NDX</strong> here and as you can see, I've circled yesterday's hourly bars, as well as the first few from today so far.</p>
                            <p>It's obvious at first glance the <strong>NDX</strong> is working to put in a bottom as I type. However, before the end of the day, if we could see one of the hours close below the 3X3 DMA (blue line) on this hourly chart here then a subsequent hour close back above it, that would give us even more context and confidence to get long some bullish leveraged index ETF's again, primarily <a href="javascript:void(null);"><strong>TQQQ</strong></a>, which tracks the <strong>NDX</strong>, and/or <a href="javascript:void(null);"><strong>TNA</strong></a>, which tracks the <strong>Russell 2000</strong>.</p>
                            <p>The signal has yet to surface and although it's definitely something we'd like to see, there's no guarantee we'll end up getting it. And, if for some reason we don't get it and yesterday's low ends up holding, the major indices still have every right to continue higher now, especially when you consider the breadth of yesterday's capitulatory move to the downside.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, even better would be to see this exact same signal surface on the daily chart of the <strong>NDX</strong> over the next several days, as it relates to the 3X3 DMA on the daily chart. However, there would have to be significantly more volatility to take place in order for that to happen.</p>
                            <p>Although the volatility is about as high as it's been in years this month, we still haven't managed to achieve the same type of volatility we had back in 2010 or 2011 yet and when you consider just how far these markets have run since then, we have every reason to want to see the volatility at least match that of either May 2010 or August of 2011 before the month ends.</p>
                            <p><strong><img src="https://static.viame.com/public_files/2014-10-16-Newsletter/2014/10/16/98df9d6775c0fec56795bdea139e0b15/vix.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #000;" /></strong>I've included a monthly chart of the <strong>VIX</strong> here to show you what I'm referring to and although I do think short-term traders too often tend to rely on the <strong>VIX</strong> on an extremely short-term basis, I think the real value in assessing its movement lies within its weekly and monthly chart, so I do strongly believe the <strong>VIX</strong> can be a great gauge of fear in terms of suggesting when the longer-term investor should start aggressively stepping back into the markets.</p>
                            <p>With that being said, this is why I mentioned yesterday it was OK for the longer-term player to start carefully wading back into longer-term positions because assuming we can finish the month of October with a much higher degree of volatility than what we've seen so far, it will strongly suggest a potential bottom that could last for a long while.</p>
                            <p>This is all obviously very hypothetical leading analysis but that's what you're signed up for here at <strong>SCN EO</strong>. There's no value in telling you about something after it happens. I strongly believe in the old adage, <strong>plan the trade and trade the plan</strong>. It requires a tremendous amount of patience and discipline to trade like this but I can assure you, the best traders aren't participating every single day, except for the professional market maker or brokerage firm desk trader.</p>
                            <p>The bottom line is I suspect if these markets are truly in a longer-term bottoming process right now, we're going to see a further increase in volatility but it's important to remember an increase in volatility doesn't necessarily mean much lower lows.</p>
                            <p>I should also point out once again <a href="javascript:void(null);"><strong>TLT</strong></a>, the primary ETF tracking bonds, is down today following yesterday's massive blow off top and equally as important, the <strong>Russell 2000</strong> is up, once again leading the markets. I mentioned this in yesterday newsletter edition, suggesting the blow off top in bonds and the fact the <strong>Russell 2000</strong> continues to outperform all of the other major indices over the last few days, is most definitely a good sign for equities right now.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, just because <a href="javascript:void(null);"><strong>TLT</strong></a> blew off like it did yesterday doesn't mean it can't retrace a good part of that major breakout move before potentially moving lower again. And, when you consider bottoms are usually a process, not an event, then the major indices have every right to make the bulls just nervous enough before they inevitably start gunning for new highs.</p>
                            <p>Regardless, the risk/reward for stepping back into these markets and starting to nibble for the long-term once again is obviously far better now than it has been for several months.</p>
                            <p>As for the short-term trader, I want to continue to reiterate the context for getting long some bullish index ETF's is now far more attractive than it has been, especially with yesterday's sharp capitulatory move and I definitely don't think now's the time to be short the major indices, unless of course you've entered into some short positions at much higher levels back when we identified the markets were in trouble.</p>
                            <p>The bottom line is if your risk tolerance is high, jumping into <a href="javascript:void(null);"><strong>TQQQ</strong></a>, <a href="javascript:void(null);"><strong>TNA</strong></a> or <a href="javascript:void(null);"><strong>SSO</strong></a> right now is worth the downside risk, as long as you are willing to maintain the discipline of cutting the trade on a break of a new low on the <strong>NDX</strong>, which currently sits just below 3,700.</p>
                            <p>Now that we've entered the teeth of the new earnings season, it's going to be paramount the overall statistics over the next few weeks favors those big and mega caps either meeting or beating their numbers. More importantly, let's pay attention to any earnings revisions or guidance on a go-forward basis because it could be those companies who move lower on the heels of good numbers that may be an excellent opportunity in the months ahead, assuming of course they don't revise forward guidance lower.</p>
