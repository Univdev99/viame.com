      <h5 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Dear Fellow Investor,</h5>
      <p>We here at <strong>SmallCap Elite Opportunity (SCN EO)</strong> understand your needs and desires to <em>maximize your capital</em> and <em>get the absolute most out of the stock market</em>, <strong>so I'm not going to beat around the bush</strong>. We've scoured the Web and have looked at countless other premium subscription based stock advisory services and <strong>we haven't found ANYBODY ANYWHERE with a better track record for 2013 than us</strong>!</p>
      <p>We've given our Members <strong>blockbuster winner after winner</strong>, month after month for a <strong>total pick performance return of over 1,732% for 2013</strong>. Is this by chance? Absolutely not. <em>We delivered very similar results in 2012 and the overall markets didn't even perform very well that year.</em></p>
      <p>While most paid subscription newsletters spend more time touting their few modest successes, their one big win, or are too busy instilling fear, doom and gloom, our dedicated team of analysts here at <strong>SCN EO</strong> are committed to the markets and <strong>devoted to uncovering stocks</strong> that will yield the type of returns only the savviest of investors will ever experience.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- end content --> 
  </div>
  
  <div class="gray" id="section2">
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Performance:<strong>Don't believe us? We can prove it.</strong></h2>
      <p>First, the table shown below is our <strong>complete list of every single stock we suggested to our Members throughout 2013</strong>, which we believed were good mid to long-term investing ideas.</p>
      <p>As you can see, <strong>the returns are nothing short of stellar</strong>. And, all you had to do was buy each one and hold it. It wasn't even necessary for you to flip in and out of any of these stocks to amass the type of gains you see here. <em>And, not one of these stocks were an overly speculative penny stock play.</em> <strong>These are real companies with real business models and real fundamentals.</strong></p>
      <p>Second, by taking advantage of our limited time <strong>two week-free trial</strong> offer right now, you will have immediate access to our exclusive password protected Member area. There, you will find every single archived daily newsletter edition to check our analysis at any point throughout the year. <strong>You can back test any or all of it. We are fully transparent with respect to our performance.</strong> We've got nothing to hide, EVER.</p>
      <p>Within our password protected Member section, you will also find every single individual stock we've suggested, when we suggested it, SSL's and target prices, as well as all of our current open ideas with the same information. Like I said, we are as transparent or in most cases more transparent than any other stock advisory service out there.</p>

      <h2>Our Philosophy:<strong>Experience, Dedication and Diligence</strong></h2>
      
      <p>We live and breathe the markets every day. We monitor the markets' every move. We're constantly scouring the various industry sectors with a fine tooth comb in an effort to identify the best and most profitable opportunities, before the rest of Wall Street has even caught on.</p>
      <p>We don't discriminate. There's money to be made in every market environment. Long, short, options, small caps, large caps, micro caps, you name it… If you spend enough time searching out and analyzing the markets with an objective and unbiased behavior, you can solidify a financial future.  The type of financial future that has made many investors multi-millionaires over the course of time.</p>
      <h3>However, it's no easy task.<br />
        <strong>It takes countless hours of research, experience and<br />
        an unwavering dedication to due diligence.</strong></h3>
      
      <p>Many investors are often left scratching their heads wondering why their value stock continues to go south. Just as important as it is to invest in good solid companies, it's equally as important to understand and know what the broader markets are doing, in addition to knowing when exactly is the right time to buy or sell a specific idea. When an investor knows and understands where the broader markets are headed and why, only then do they have a distinct advantage over the rest of the investing population.</p>
      <p>Fundamental or technical analysis, which is better? Depending on whom you talk to, veterans of each camp will tell you either technical analysis or fundamental analysis is the only way to go. This is another investing facade. The truth is charts are equally as important as fundamentals and vice versa. In order to maximize investing returns, <strong>it's equally as important to know when to invest in a particular idea, <em style="font-weight: bold;">as it is to know which idea to invest in</em>.</strong></p>

      <h2>Your Opportunity:<br />
        <strong>An Integral Part of Your Investing Arsenal</strong></h2>

      <p><strong>As you can see, we're serious about delivering you an opportunity to improve your financial future.</strong> You only have so much time in the day. We're making ourselves available to you in a dedicated fashion that makes us an integral part of your investing arsenal.</p>
      <p>We're here to help you create a better financial future for yourself and your family. We're not going to let anyone decide for us or pay us to suggest an opportunity. By becoming a SmallCap Network Elite Opportunity Member, you will have a dedicated and highly experienced team of individuals working on your behalf every day to keep you up-to-date and well informed on the stock market and its winning ways.</p>
      <p>Is there really much to think about? For just $99 per month or less, depending on which subscription package you choose, you will now have the necessary arsenal at your fingertips to exploit the markets for maximum returns.  You can't even play a single round of golf in many cities anymore for less than $99. However, by getting our daily market analysis, select stock recommendations and invaluable continuing education on the subject of investing in stocks, you'll be putting yourself and your family in a much better position to dramatically improve your long-term financial future.</p>
      <h3>Ask yourself this question, "Would I pay a dedicated team of experienced professionals a total of $99 per month who will work diligently five days a week to help me become more profitable?"<br />
        <strong>The answer should be pretty simple.</strong></h3>
      
      <p>And, if you're wondering why we don't charge less, the answer is quite simple again. Our information is not only worth a lot more, it's also our way of keeping the masses out of our way and our discreet analysis off the radar. When too many people are hearing about an extremely hot opportunity, it can often become an overly crowded trade. That wouldn't be good for you or us.</p>
      <p>Once you become a <strong>SmallCap Network Elite Opportunity Member</strong>, you can then ignore all of the touts and false promises made by so many other newsletters that only end up failing to deliver.</p>
      <p>The bottom line is this. Regardless of what many will tell you, identifying the right ideas isn't easy, there's no easy recipe and there's definitely no obvious homeruns when it comes to investing in stocks. It's a big boy's and big girl's game that rewards the most diligent investors. Let us start working for you. We don't think you'll be disappointed, at all.</p>
