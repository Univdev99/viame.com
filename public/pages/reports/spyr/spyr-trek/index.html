		<p>SPYR, Inc. <strong>(OTCQB: SPYR)</strong> continues to grow its customer base and add dedicated fans around the globe with its innovative and addicting mobile game Pocket Starships.

		</p><p>
		Pocket Starships is a Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) free-to-play/freemium action game that allows players to build and pilot numerous starships in real-time space battles, recruit players and form strong alliances, and battle with and against thousands of other players worldwide on a quest for galactic domination.
		</p><p>
		Starting in November 2017, Pocket Starships players will be able to explore new sectors of the game’s universe in which players will be able to acquire various <i>Star Trek</i>&trade; upgrades such as ships and weapons from <i>Star Trek</i>: The Next Generation, <i>Star Trek</i>: Deep Space Nine, and <i>Star Trek</i>: Voyager.</p>

		<h1>With its flagship game Pocket Starships, SPYR has published a unique true cross-platform game that can be played in real time on a variety of devices. So whether you are playing on your Apple or Android phone, laptop, desktop, iPad or Kindle, all gamers can play together and against one another in the same game universe.</h1>
		<img src="images/img-connected.jpg" class="full" alt="Real Time Cross-Platform Technology" />
		<p>This platform allows SPYR to effectively position and market Pocket Starships to a larger gaming audience.  Pocket Starships can be accessed through app download, or through social media portals such as Facebook and VK.com. The <i>Star Trek</i> integration could take Pocket Starships to the next level, increasing its visibility in the MMO and esports arenas.</p>
		<p class="callout">Says James R. Thompson, SPYR’s CEO and President:</p>
		<p class="quote">Pocket Starships and <i>Star Trek</i> are a perfect fit, with both Pocket Starships and <i>Star Trek</i> celebrating a spirit of exploration and cooperation. We think that <i>Star Trek</i> fans will enthusiastically embrace the new Star Trek-based content we will be adding to Pocket Starships.  We are confident that with Pocket Starship’s real-time, cross platform MMO gameplay, together, CBS Consumer Products and SPYR can take Pocket Starships and <i>Star Trek</i> mobile games where on one has gone before."</p>

<div class="content content-7">
	<div class="wrapper">
		<p>The <i>Star Trek</i> franchise is massive – pairing nicely with an MMO like Pocket Starships.  The <i>Star Trek</i> film franchise is estimated to have grossed around $2.2 billion worldwide; <i>Star Trek</i> Beyond, released in 2016 had worldwide box office of $336 million, and domestic video sales of $35 million. The real question isn't, "How much has it grossed?" It's "How much is it worth?" According to CNBC, <i>Star Trek</i> as a franchise may be worth north of $5 billion dollars. 
		</p><p>
		While the real financial value of <i>Star Trek</i> may be up for discussion, clearly the audience is vast - and steadfast, with an estimated 40 million "Trekkies" worldwide.  
		</p><p>
		Combining those fans with the growing market of mobile gaming, which is expected to cross the $130 billion threshold in the next three years, SPYR, Inc. has created a winning combination in their partnership with CBS Consumer Products for licensing of the <i>Star Trek</i> property.

		<p>The Pocket Starships development team is already working on expansions of Pocket Starships to include the Star Trek IP, which SPYR expects will be released by the end of October of 2017.  This means that in November, Pocket Starships players will be able to explore new sectors and engage in exciting battles with a certain assimilating Collective, with players being able to acquire various <i>Star Trek</i>&trade; upgrades such as ships and weapons from <i>Star Trek:</i> The Next Generation, <i>Star Trek:</i> Deep Space Nine, and <i>Star Trek:</i> Voyager.</p>
		<p>The assimilation of <i>Star Trek</i> into Pocket Starships is an example of the right brand, and the right game, in the right hands, marketed the right way.  With MMOs showing infinite popularity and growth, especially with the increasing popularity of esports and cross platform gaming, the M&A opportunities in the video game market are stellar. Investors will look for strong brands with strong financials, and SPYR is leading the way with smart games and smart partnerships.</p>
