		<p><img src="images/spyr-logo.png" class="right third" alt="SPYR Logo" />While small cap mobile gaming stock <strong>SPYR, Inc. (OTCQB: <a href="https://www.smallcapnetwork.com/SPYR-SPYR-Inc/s/quote/p/s/SPYR/">SPYR</a>)</strong> may not be well known outside of the gaming industry, its well positioned in both the mobile gaming and the burgeoning esports market for growth. This also makes the stock a possible acquisition target by bigger players in a space that's already abuzz with M&A activity. To fully appreciate just what a hidden gem this company is though, you have to take a step back and look at the landscape of two different market's nobody saw coming just a few years ago.</p>
		<p>It's hard believe, but it was only ten years ago that mobile gaming was in its infancy, following the debut of the Apple iPhone. Indeed, 'mobile gaming' wasn't even a term at the time. What a difference a decade can make!</p>
		<p>It leads one to wonder what the digital landscape will look like ten years from now. After all, a decade ago, nobody could have imagined mobile games would become the <b>$40 billion market</b> VentureBeat says it is now. By that same token, investors are also certainly wondering which companies will be the ones to get the market from where it is today to where it's going to be in 2027.</p>
		<p class="callout">As it turns out, glimpses of the future are starting to come into view.</p>
		<p><b>Ever heard of esports?</b> Don't sweat it if you've never heard the term... that's kind of the point. This is a fairly new concept, and potent simply because most investors have yet to connect the dots.</p>
		<p><b>esports</b>&mdash;short for electronic sports&mdash;is (literally) an organized, tournament-driven league of video game play. Not only do these athletes get paid to play, fans pay to watch them play. Some of the leagues are single-player contests, while others are team-based, where a group of gamers work together to complete a virtual mission or achieve a collective goal. While gamers love to play, like traditional sports fans, they love to watch the pros play the same game at a much higher caliber. Fans watch the event online, or sometimes fill up stadiums to watch the events on big screens... tens of thousands at a time.</p>
		<p class="callout">And the numbers involved are big... REAL BIG.</p>

		<h1>Video game information outfit Newzoo estimates the esports market was worth $463 million last year, and will exceed $1 billion by 2019.</h1>
		<img src="images/growth2.png" class="full mobileOff" alt="esports Growth from 2014-2019" />
		<img src="images/growth.png" class="full mobileOn" alt="esports Growth from 2014-2019" />
		<p>Research firm SuperData has estimated the esports market alone earned $892.8 million in revenue last year when looking at every dollar it ultimatly generates,  and this figure is expected to rise to over <b>$1 billion in 2017</b> to reach the $1.23 billion level by 2019 with big name advertisers and sponsors like Coca-Cola and Nissan already starting to pour money into the niche. </p>
		<img src="images/ps_logo2.png" class="right half" alt="Pocket Starships Logo" />
		<p class="callout">SPYR Has a Standout Game That Could be the Next esports Hit</p>
		<p>As for where SPYR <i>(pronounced 'spire', by the way)</i> and its <b>Pocket Starships</b> game fit into the picture, this is where things get really exciting.</p>
		<p><b>Pocket Starships</b> is a Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) free-to-play/freemium action game where players can build and pilot numerous starships in real-time space battles, recruit players and form strong alliances, and battle with and against thousands of other players worldwide on a quest for galactic domination. In other words, it's a lot of fun. And, as much as casual gamers like to play, they love watching other, better gamers demonstrate an almost artistic proficiency, kind of like when a quarterback completes a pass to a wide receiver in a way that doesn't seem possible.</p>
		<p class="callout">This game is unlike most other games out there, however, and it makes a HUGE difference.</p>
		<p><b>How is it different?</b> Pocket Starships can be played in real-time with multiple players participating regardless of the kind of device each player is using. In other words, a gamer in New York can play on a personal computer, doing battle against a gamer in California who's playing on an Android tablet, who's teamed up with a player in Hawaii using an iPhone.... you get the idea. It's a true cross-platform, real-time, multiplayer video game, and works equally well on all devices. That flexibility makes it appealing to a wide array of gamers, and therefore makes it appealing to a wide number of sponsors... sponsors that drive about 3/4 of the esports industry's revenue.  <b>It's very rare to see a game of such quality and depth be that flexible.</b></p>

		<h2>Video Game Industry Getting Real Big, Real Fast</h2>
		<div class="invest-3 invest-block">
		<strong>FORECAST</strong>
		Data from Statista.com forecasts that 1.5 billion smartphones will be sold this year alone
		</div>
		<div class="invest-3 invest-block">
		<strong>REACH</strong>
		1.49 billion people that will be considered mobile gamers by the end of 2017, more than 50% greater than the mobile gamer headcount from 2015

		<div class="invest-3 invest-block">
		<strong>GROWTH</strong>
		PwC thinks the mobile gaming market will grow an average of 4.2% every year through 2020

	<div class="wrapper">
		<p>See, though the esports market has been taking shape for a few years now, it's been missing the boat, so to speak. The esports opportunity for mobile games could be five times bigger than PC-only games like League of Legends&mdash;one of the esports world's favorite digital venues&mdash;not just because of the sheer number of mobile devices there are compared to personal computers, but because downloads of mobile games can be done anytime, anywhere, in a just a few seconds.</p>
		<h1>Acquisitions Are the Name of the Game</h1>

		<p>The newest chapter in the rise of esports: Acquisitions; and plenty of them. Industry news website Pocketgamer listed the deals in the video gaming space, and there were too many to show you here. <b>Even just these highlights, however, make the point:</b></p>
		<div class="ma">
			<h2>M&amp;A is Running Rampant within the Video Game Industry!</h2>

			<div class="date">JUL 18, 2016</div>
			<div class="desc">Chinese companies including Qihoo 360 and Kunlun Games bought Opera's consumer businesses for $600 million.</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="date">JUL 30, 2016</div>
			<div class="desc">A Chinese consortium called Giant Interactive Group spent $4.4 billion to acquire Playtika.</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="date">NOV 22, 2016</div>
			<div class="desc">Chinese publisher 37 Interactive snapped up Mokun Technology, one of China's most recently successful developers, for $198.1 million.</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="date">FEB 17, 2017</div>
			<div class="desc desclast">Keywords International continued an acquisition spree with a $1.5 million purchase of animation studio Spov.</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>

		</div>
		<p>And when you look just a little further back in time, the deals get even bigger, and come from bigger companies. A couple of years ago e-commerce giant Amazon.com spent nearly a billion dollars to acquire a company called Twitch, which simply lets people watch other people play video games online. Then there's the recent success of Pok&eacute;mon Go (Nintendo), which melded the real world with the gaming world using so-called augmented reality. Nintendo didn't build all of that game itself&mdash;much of the technology needed to make the augmented reality game work so well on smartphones was actually garnered through acquisitions that total well into the tens of millions of dollars. In February of last year, game publisher Activision-Blizzard spent $5.9 billion to purchase King Digital, which makes the wildly popular Candy Crush game. </p>
		<p><b>The land-grab is on.</b> Even the Wall Street Journal noticed it, saying last year "A record year in videogame deal making is turning attention to smaller mobile-game developers now that most bigger targets have been gobbled up." Digi-Capital estimated that by the time 2016 came to a close, <b>$30 billion had been spent on video game deals.</b></p>
		<p class="callout">Take the hint.</p>
		<p class="quote">"A record year in video game deal-making is turning attention to smaller mobile-game developers now that most bigger targets have been gobbled up." - Wall Street Journal</p>
		<div class="break"></div>
		<h1>More Game Titles On the Way (the smart way)</h1>
		<p>That being said, it's not just Pocket Starships that would be of interest to a potential buyer. SPYR, Inc. has plenty to offer any suitor in that it has developed and published a diverse range of fun and engaging social games for mobile devices:</p>
		<ul>
		    <li><strong>Home Makeover 4</strong>  is a casual hidden object game and is the newest game in the successful Home Makeover hidden object game series for mobile devices.</li>
			<li><b>Pocket Starships</b> is a free-to-play, Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) space combat game.</li>
			<li><b>RetroShot</b> creates cities of neon lights filled with explosions and lasers awaiting gamers who take on the machine in an 80's arcade flashback.</li>
			<li>As the <b>Rune Guardian</b>, gamers help to restore order to Kilarin so its beautiful worlds can once again thrive.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>More games are on the way though. SPYR, Inc.'s growth strategy calls for publishing between four and six games per year, through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions focused on mobile applications and game development. </p>
		
		<!--
		<p>At first glance, these growth plans might seem like a tall order given the following challenges being faced by the gaming industry. These challenges are...</p>
		
		<div class="invest-block invest-2">
		<strong>DISCOVERY</strong>
		Developers have a hard time getting their titles discovered (Mobile Cost-Per-Install Rates are High).</div>
		<div class="invest-block invest-2">
		<strong>DISTRIBUTION</strong>
		PC sales are declining.</div>
		<div class="clear"></div>
		<div class="invest-block invest-2"><strong>ENGAGEMENT</strong>Many passive users are not active or are inactive.</div>
		<div class="invest-block invest-2"><strong>MONETIZATION</strong>Can be very difficult and challenging.</div>
		<div class="clear"></div>
		
		<p><b>SPYR's got something of a secret weapon though.</b> That is, SPYR, Inc. can buy traffic cheaper online (0.25c vs. $5-$15 over Mobile) as well as leverage partners to accomplish the same. Moreover, SPYR, Inc. has a proven partnership model where they offer to do everything a game developer doesn't necessarily want to do themselves, including monetization, analytics, revenue optimization, marketing, and partnership distribution deals.</p>

		<h3>SPYR turns good games into great games</h3>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="content content-9">
	<div class="wrapper">
		<p>By engaging in strategic partnerships, SPYR, Inc. is able to publish new games and recommend content for existing games to keep gamers engaged and to further accelerate growth. Makes sense. Developing games is difficult, risky, and can be expensive if it doesn't excite players. That's why SPYR has focused on getting good at spotting games with a lot of potential that just need the right tweak.</p>
		<p>As validation of the strategy, earlier this year Swedish game developer Gaming Corps came right out and said it' changing its strategy from game-development to game-acquisitions. Point being, SPYR has its finger on the pulse of how this business works.</p>
		<p class="callout">And there's no way to say the company doesn't have more than its fair share of the right, experienced, brilliant personnel.</p>
		<div class="break"></div>
		<h1>Experience, Experience, Experience</h1>
		<p><b>Lars Koschin isn't exactly a household name... depending on your household.</b> For the 1.8 billion global video gamers, the name is familiar. Koschin is one of the premier developers of multiplayer online games, and was involved with a company called Wargaming when it created the hugely successful MMO game called 'World of Tanks.' SPYR says that game, by the way, generated $1.3 billion worth of revenue over the course of the prior three years.  </p>
		<p>Koschin was also one of the creators of early and popular MMO title 'Runes of Magic,' and a co-founder of Gamigo... one of the gaming industry's biggest online game magazines and MMO publishers. </p>
		<p class="callout">In other words, he's got the chops. If Koschin is involved, it's going to be good.</p>
		<p><b>And it has been.</b> Largely following the same formula as World of Tanks, Pocket Starships should at least yield similar success. In fact, it's likely to create more monetary success, should it become one of the preferred battlegrounds within the esports world like we think it will.</p>
		<p>It's not just big names like Koschin getting on board though. A guy named <strong>Mike Turner</strong> also joined the fold in mid-2016, bolstering the company's roster. </p>
    	<p>An online games industry veteran, Mike has held leadership roles for companies such as Wargaming America, Inc. (the developer and publisher of World of Tanks), Big Collision Games and FASA Studios at Microsoft.  While at Wargaming, Turner drove partnership activities for Wargaming's own esports organization in the Americas, the Wargaming.net League.  The League is the pinnacle of competition where pro gamers from around the world compete for cash prizes and worldwide recognition.  Having previously delivered partnerships with gaming market leaders like Twitch, Intel, & Nvidia for Wargaming,  Mike intends to take SPYR's flagship game, Pocket Starships in a more competitive direction, where he believes the game will be well received by esports fans.</p>
        <p>Mike has most recently worked for iDreamSky Technology as its VP of the West where he continued to grow his international network of contacts, particularly in Asia, where iDreamSky is based.  Mike was also the President of byDesign Interactive Corp., a company that provides game industry development and consulting services for companies like Microsoft, EA, Wild Tangent, Sky Digital Solutions and other game publishers and developers.</p>
		<p>And he feels very good about the company's prospects with Pocket Starships in stable, recently saying of the game's cross-platform flexibility: </p>
		<p class="quote">"... Having the ability to practice on your home PC, but to train on your mobile while you are on the go, makes things much easier and puts the customer at the center of everything. Most cross platform games can become unbalanced, where you would not want a PC gamer playing against a Console player since the control scheme is not equal. Pocket Starships has shown more flexibility and consistently delivered balanced battles, no matter which machine you are logged into."</p>
	    <p>SPYR recently announced that Farshid Almassizadeh, the former VP and COO of EA Interactive, will join the SPYR team as its Chief Strategic Advisor. Mr. Almassizadeh will bring his 25+ years of experience in the gaming industry to SPYR as an advisor to SPYR's management team, the game publishing team, as well as the associated developer community. Mr. Almassizadeh has held executive positions, including COO of EA Interactive and Senior Director of Product Development for The Simpsons and The Sims Console franchises, at Electronic Arts. He is presently an executive at Age of Learning and previously held an executive position at GlobalWide Media. Mr. Almassizadeh is a proven and versatile senior executive with a measurable record of success building international organizations and running profitable businesses within the console, mobile, online, advertising, educational, social games and entertainment industries over the last 25+ years. He has also served as an advisory board member to companies in the apps and entertainment space, including Relationup, Halon Entertainment, 2Mundos and MATTERvr.</p>
		<p class="callout">Point being, an awful lot of industry veterans want to come work for SPYR. It makes you wonder why. Actually, it's no wonder at all.</p>
		<p>With all of that being said, though we've been viewing SPYR  through acquisition-colored glasses, we have to confess there's a certain curiosity about how things might turn out if the company were to remain on its own. There's a good reason for supporting that route too. </p>

		<h3>One video game estimated to be worth $1.5 billion in just a few years!</h3>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="content content-11 ">
	<div class="wrapper">
		<p>The previously mentioned game called World of Tanks, from Wargaming? The game's creator, Victor Kislyi, was recently deemed a billionaire, as his company was estimated to sport an enterprise value of $1.5 billion according to Bloomberg. He started that game in an apartment for next to nothing. How would you like to go back and invest in World of Tanks or League of Legends now? </p>
		<p>The right game in the right hands marketed the right way can be ridiculously big cash cow, so if SPYR were to continue on its own, that too looks like it could be a very fruitful path to take.</p>
		<div class="break"></div>
		<h1>What You (as an Investor) Need to Do Next...</h1>
		<p>The way we see it, Pocket Starships is likely to carry SPYR ahead in a way few investors fully appreciate or fully understand right now. Its staffing is top-notch, the game it's focusing on is ideal in that anyone can play from any device but it's still well-suited for the esports pros, and the joint rise of mobile gaming and esports in particular is on the verge of blasting off. <strong>It's an investment trifecta you may only see a handful of times in your entire lifetime.</strong></p>
		<p><b>So, what you need to do next is simple</b>&mdash;do your normal due diligence you would do on any stock, read everything you just read again, talk it over with a professional, and then if it's the right risk/reward scenario, move forward with SPYR.</p>
		<p>That's not all you may want to do though. Regardless of what you decide to do today, tomorrow, or down the road, sign up for the free daily <strong>SmallCap Network newsletter</strong> to <strong>receive regular updates on SPYR</strong> and all of the other small cap stocks we keep tabs on. <strong>We intend to keep a close watch on this exciting growth story as several of its initiatives start to get major traction.
